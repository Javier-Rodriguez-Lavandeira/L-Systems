# L-Systems
This project presents the development of an interactive deterministic L-System
editor and renderer built in Unity. The goal of the project was to create a flexible
tool that allows users to define, visualise, and explore Lindenmayer Systems in a
real-time environment. The application allows users to explore eight predefined tree
models, step through their iterations, and adjust parameters such as angle, segment
length, and line width. Additionally, users can create entirely new deterministic
L-Systems through an intuitive graphical interface. The system combines real-time
visual feedback with hotkey-based controls, making it suitable for experimentation,
education, and rapid iteration during development
